"The Odin Project" projects by me, Edgar @safarinexus. Meant to demonstrating undergoing and completion of "The Odin Project" in full, as well as display fullstack web development skills learnt. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you into my projects, understand their context and how to enjoy and admire them.

### Prerequisites

No substantial software required, just a modern-browser will suffice.

### Installing

No installation needed. Just click on links provided and open them up in a browser of your choice.

### Path 

The Odin Project provides two paths for aspiring developers to go down, Full Stack Ruby on Rails path or Full Stack JavaScript (Node.js) Path. I chose the Node.js path, for more relevancy and interest.
